## Introduction

This documentation assumes that you are a Flutter developer using Dart. Therefore, unnecessary explanations have been avoided for better clarity of the project structure and code.

## Project Structure

The project follows the **MVVM architecture** and maintains **SOLID principles** and **Clean Architecture** for better maintainability and scalability. The following tree structure represents the project layout:

```

### Explanation of Dependencies

- `dio` â†’ For RESTful communication with the server.
- `get` â†’ For dependency injection.
- `connectivity_plus` â†’ To check internet connectivity.
- `flutter_secure_storage` â†’ For secure local storage.
- `cached_network_image` â†’ For handling network images.
- `smooth_page_indicator` â†’ For displaying page indicators.
- `go_router` â†’ For navigation and routing.
- `flutter_inappwebview` â†’ For embedding web applications in mobile/web views.

## Asset Folder

Contains application resources such as fonts and images.

## Common Module

Contains reusable components used across the application.

- **`ui/`** â†’ Customized UI components.
- **`custom_bottom_navigation/`** â†’ A shared bottom navigation component.
- **`util/`** â†’ Utility classes and helper methods.
- **`constant/`** â†’ Stores static values like colors, fonts, and image paths.

## Feature Module

Each feature is implemented in its own module within the `features/` directory following the MVVM architecture.

## Navigation Module

Handles application routing:

- **To** â†’ Navigates to a new screen.
- **Back** â†’ Navigates back to the previous screen.
- **ClearAndNavigate** â†’ Clears the stack and navigates to a new screen.

## app_bindings File

Manages dependency injections for the entire application.

## app_router File

Defines application routing and the initial screen to launch.

## main File

This is the entry point of the application where the initial configurations, routing, and dependency injections are defined.
